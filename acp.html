    <p>Valorant players suck because they spend more time whining about bad teammates than actually improving. They
        think
        spamming "GG EZ" in chat makes them a tactical genius, but in reality, they're just bottom-fragging wannabe pros
        who
        watch TenZ clips and think it transfers to their gameplay. Half of them can't aim, the other half have the game
        sense of
        a goldfish, and yet every single one of them acts like a washed-up ex-radiant who got "unlucky" with their team.
        They
        blame hit registration, peekerâ€™s advantage, and lag, but never consider that maybe, just maybe, theyâ€™re trash.
        And donâ€™t
        even get started on their commsâ€”either it's a dead-silent lobby or some 14-year-old screeching about how it's
        *always*
        someone elseâ€™s fault. Play the game, stop making excuses, and maybe, just maybe, you'll rank up past hardstuck
        Gold.</p>
